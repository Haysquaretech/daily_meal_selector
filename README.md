This simple Python programming is written to randomly select three square_meal per day.

It is easy to modify by adding/removing a particular food from a category and add it to another category. For instance, removing 'Semo with Efo Riro' from Breakfast category and add it to Lunch category because I love swallow foods for lunch.
